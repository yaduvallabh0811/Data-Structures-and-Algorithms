I implemented Stacks and Queue Data Structures in C language Using Arrays and Sequential Mapping.
The sequential mapping has the property that successive data objects are stored at fixed distance apart.Thus,the successive locations in the memory are ensured for list.
when a Sequential mapping is used for ordered lists,operations such as insertion and delteion of arbitrary elements becomes tedious.There should of data in the structure.
so, to avoid data movement while deleting and inserting in sequential representation alternatively we use LINKED LISTS.
The elements in the Linked List is called as Node.It contains the Data element and a Pointer(link) to the next node.
